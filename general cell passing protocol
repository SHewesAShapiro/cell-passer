PASSING CELLS
Person takes the flask out of the incubator.
PART 1
Put in hood
unscrew cap and remove media
Wash the cells with PBS
Put trypsin (~3-5 ml). distribute over cells
let sit for ~3-5 min
tap flask
neutralize with media
INTERMISSION
spin down (take out and do this manually)
PART 2
aspirate media from cell pellet
resuspend in a volume
put fraction (1/6 volume) into flask with media
bleach or use cells


CHANGING MEDIA
1. remove old media
2. put in new media

would need:
whole part that touches the cells needs to be autoclavable
special cap (vented)
two reservoirs (old media and new media)
pump (or two) to remove old media completely and put new media
housing that is smooth and can be sprayed with ethanol

extra things: bluetooth control + app
camera to verify everything is ok (or to look at cells)
ice pack with insulation for new media (release and heat up + temperature sensor)







cell passer or media changer?
